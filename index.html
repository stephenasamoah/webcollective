                <p>
                    My love for design started in 2009 on an online MMORPG community forum. I wanted to create one of
                    the
                    cool forum signatures everyone was having for myself, but had no idea where to begin.
                </p>

                <p>Fast-forward 2 weeks and I was still losing sleep over it. I made the big step by finally taking
                    a few online tutorials on "sig-making". That was the first time I discovered the near-euphoric
                    feeling of actually doing something you love.
                    <br>
                    It gradually became a hobby that I indulged in for the years that followed, and not just in making
                    forum
                    signatures.
                </p>


                <p>Even though graphic design gave me a sense of achievement, there was still something missing.
                    I like to solve visual problems, specifically through analytical means if possible. So far, I wasn't
                    getting
                    enough of that with designing alone
                    (occasionally trying to illustrate on my Wacom tablet. <a
                            href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/28537439/Turtle-Illustration" target="_blank"
                            class="inline--link">I wasn't that great</a>).</p>

                <p>Either way, I finally decided to pursue a professional career in design at NIIT in 2014. I
                    had a great job at the pharmacy by then, but most of my time off work was spent poring over design
                    and illustration tutorials. I was good at my job, but it just wasn't for me.
                </p>

                <p>The graphic design course at NIIT came with a Web Development package. I was curious about web
                    development since I had no prior experience with it whatsoever.</p>

                <p>Upon starting the Web Development course after completing the graphic design module, I realised a
                    week in that it was what I'd been waiting for
                    all along. I get to design, but in a manner that involved building with code, analysing it and
                    fixing bugs. It was perfect for me.</p>

                <p>To date, not a day has gone by when I don't meddle and tinker with some code. I am absolutely certain
                    I've found a career path I'm truly passionate about.
